# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

## Other than this file the project contains 3 more files. Their details are below:

### 1. InitialAnalysis.R
This file particularly does the analysis on the entire dataset and finds which text files are necessary and forms the basis for merging, i.e., it decides which data files should be merged from the train and test dataset for final results. Also proper documentation is available inside the code file.
### 2. run_analysis.R
As instructed, this file contains the 5 step process as described. But, here some steps are interchanged but the final result comes out correct no matter what. 
### 3. CodeBook.md
This file contains the self-describing name of the variables and also the entire list of the variables(including label(for labelling data ranging from 1 to 30) and activities(for activities data ranging from 1 to 6)
